          <h4>Who am I?</h4>
          <p>I am a graduate student at George Washington University pursuing a Masters in Computer Science with interests in Software Development and Database Management. In the daytime, I work as a Web Application Development Intern. I enjoy solving problems with technology which I think is an extension of programming.</p>

          <h4>Why are you taking this course?</h4>
          <p>I have never taken a formal class in Web Application Development so this is actually a new realm for me. I am excited to sharpen my skills as a web application developer and learn more about Laravel, a relatively new PHP framework that I have never worked with.</p>

          <h4>What previous experience do you have with programming?</h4>
          <p>For the most part, I am a self-taught programmer with very few programming courses. I have worked with C, Java, HTML, CSS, Javascript, and a little bit of PHP. I think one of the greatest things about programming is that once you learn one langugage really well, it becomes relatively easy to pick up others.</p>

          <h4>Are you working on a Mac or some other platform?</h4>
          <p>I have been a Windows fanatic for a large part of my life. But now, I use Mac for all of my work.</p>

          <h4>Anything else we should know?</h4>
          <p>You're probably already wondering from the picture. Yes, I have two Yorkys and they are really amazing companions.</p>
